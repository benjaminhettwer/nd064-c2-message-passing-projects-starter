Person Microservice: The Person Microservice encapsulates all the necessary functionality related to persons, including CRUD operations. 
It offers its services through a user-friendly REST interface and a reliable GRPC server.

Connections Microservice: The Connections Microservice provides a convenient way to add locations through a REST interface. 
This microservice efficiently forwards incoming requests to a Kafka queue, ensuring that it can handle a substantial number of concurrent PUT requests,
potentially reaching millions.

Additionally, the Connections Microservice also offers the capability to find connections using the connections service. 
To achieve this, it utilizes the person microservice, accessed through a grpc client, as well as the locations service. 
To simplify the sharing of models, both the location service and the connection service have been integrated into the same microservice.
